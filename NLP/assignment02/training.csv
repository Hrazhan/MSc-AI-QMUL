"1358"	"6"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Not at the school one, no - but who wants to go there anyway? A load of spotty boys who can't even drive? I don't think so. We'll just jump a tube into Soho, go to a proper club."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"6"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"What?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"6"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"I'll nick some booze beforehand - vodka's best cos you can't smell it - you like vodka, don't you?"	"FEMALE"

"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"It's about Honey. Not wanting to move into Pat's."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"She wants to stay with us cos she thinks that's what we want."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"It's not just that - she likes being part of the family, she thinks all of you are great."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Based on what?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Beats me, I tell you."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"Well, she ain't exactly playing with a full deck, is she? No offence."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Or maybe she's just nicer than all you lot."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"Nicer than you, that's for sure. Billy thinks about having sex with us. Tell Honey that she'd move out."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"I do not think about having sex with you. Look, I am a happily married man."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"Cousins can still do it, he said. Told me it wasn't illegal. You know, in case it was that holding us back. Yes, right."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"You alright? Phil?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Yes. I'm fine. Look, let's solve this once and for all."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Billy, you can have Ronnie's room - Ronnie, you'll have to share with Roxy."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"What?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Or get Honey to accept Pat's offer. It's up to you."	"MALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Well, he's in a good mood."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"There is no way I'm sharing with you. I'm going to talk to Peggy."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"7"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Don't worry. You'll be in Pat's by the end of the day. Trust me."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"Thanks for coming. This is better, isn't it? We can talk properly now. Say what we want to say. Rather than what people we care about want to hear."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"So all that crap you came out with last night -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"No, that was true. I do want us to get on. I like Ronnie, so obviously, it's in my interests. But it's not in your interests, is it Phil? You're thinking - why should I make the effort to get along with this cocky gitwho I don't even like."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Yes, that about sums it up."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"Here's why."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"One car. That's all I'm asking."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Forget it. From now on that place is legit. No more stolen motors, no cut and shuts - you want to kill someone else, do you?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Okay, just give me the bloke's phone number. I'll arrange it without you."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"He'd hang up as soon as you asked. It's too dangerous. The police nearly had us both the last time."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"And with all this new evidence - they still might."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"You're a stupid man, Phil. You pick fights with people you know nothing about, with no understanding of how they might react. Well, you know now, don't you?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"That ain't nothing."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"It's enough. With what the police already have? More than. You sold stolen cars to Kevin Wicks who then died driving one - Yes, that's it. Keep thinking with your fists. Make it even easier for me, why don't you? No, there's no-one else here. And I ain't recording it neither, but you've had your cheap sucker punch. You want to go toe to toe when my back ain't turned, let's do it - see how long you last."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"What do you want?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"For the tape? Nothing. I'm going to give you it back. It's just a warning, Phil. Take me seriously. Treat me with respect."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"And that's it?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"That and the car lot, yes."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"What?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"You're going to sell me the freehold for the car lot. At half the market price. As a way of apologizing. Let's call it a gesture of friendship."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Let's not."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"That's bad news for Ben, isn't it? Cos once I give that tape to the police, you won't be seeing him for quite a while."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"You taking the long term view of all this?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"More than you ever did. See, I make it my business to know exactly who I'm dealing with, what they're capable of. Shame you never did the same. Just be grateful all I want is the car lot. You've got until 5pm."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"I don't own that land."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"I know. Peggy does. That's not my problem."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"I tell Ronnie this, it will be. That's you and her over -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"You tell Ronnie this, the tape goes to the police. You threaten Darren, it goes to the police. This is just between you and me. To clear the air. Make things even between us. See, I really did try and help you with Louise, Phil, and now you owe me something in return. So why don't you phone your bent solicitor Ritchie Scott and start saving yourself while you still can."	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"You really want to do this?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"8"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"I am doing it."	"MALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"But this awful, I had no idea."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Me neither. Roxy only told me yesterday."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"She's in love with my Billy?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Pretty much ever since we arrived. She said it was one of those, first sight, pow..."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well, yes, it was the same with me. When I looked at him, I could barely breathe, he was just so..."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Isn't he. But don't you see? That's why it's been so hard for Roxy, to have you all living here - the man of her dreams. So close, so unavailable -"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"That's not why she was in our room the night before, was it?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"It might well have been, yes. She did say she was finding it harder than ever not to tell him. Not to be near him. Touch him. Although she swears she never will."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"So my Billy doesn't know?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"No. No-one does. Just me. And now you. But you must never tell Roxy I've told you this - she'd be mortified."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Eh?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Very upset. Honey, Roxy loves you too, you're family and she would never do anything to hurt you - even though you being here, is like the worst form of torture -"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Oh, my goodness."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"It's cruel really. Not that any of you are to blame."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well, no but even so... Oh poor Roxy. I know the power Billy has over people. Women especially."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"9"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"I've felt it too."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"10"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"It's not happening, I tell you. I am not sharing that box room with Ronnie - I just can't."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"10"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Okay. Just calm down."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"10"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"No, you don't understand. I'd go mad. I'd kill her. I'd kill all of you, I know I would -"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"10"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well, none of us wants that now, do we? Look, I'm sure - Oh, hello Honey. No, don't worry, she's fine, Phil's upset her over something, that's all."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"10"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Roxy, I just wanted to say, we're going to go to Pat's. Today. I'm sorry but it's for the best. For everyone. I'm going to start packing straight away."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"10"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Don't be sad. You're a wonderful person and there will be someone else out there just as wonderful for you too. I know it."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"10"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well, let's go and help her before she changes her mind."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"So what are my options?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Without listening to the tape it's difficult to say - how incriminating, is it?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"I basically admit I sold stolen cars, cut n shuts -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"And this Darren boy who taped you? Why would he have done this?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"He blames me for what happened to Kevin Wicks- they were pretty close."	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"So as well as the tape we can assume Jack's also got a statement from him? What about the man who sold you the cars - could Jack have got to him too?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"No. Dougie's solid. It's just the tape and the kid."	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"And whatever forensics they have, plus all the circumstantial evidence -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"You saying I should make a deal?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"If you do - will he honour it? Give you the tape back?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"After making a few dozen copies for the future, yes, why the hell not? If I fold once he can do it again, go for this place next."	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Even so. My advice - for what's it worth - is to accept his proposition."	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"No way."	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"It buys us time. And gets us the tape. Even if it's a copy I can work out how damaging it is and find a way to limit that threat. It could even be inadmissable -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"He ain't having that car lot."	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Just think of it as a loan. You'll get it back -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"11"	"ARCHES INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Too right I will. That's my mother's property we're talking about. The only way he'll get to keep that permanently is if I bury him in it. Right next to Darren. No-one blackmails me and gets away with it."	"MALE"
"1358"	"13"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Hello? Yes this is Lorraine Cross. Yes, I give my consent. Yes, tell her."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"13"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"Hello? Speaking. Its about the drug tests results yes? And? And what does that mean? No, for me. And my kids, the court case, what does that... I see. Right. Yes, I will. Thank you. Bye."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"13"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well? What did they say?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"14"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Peter. It's me. Just so you know. I'll be taking your training today as usual."	"MALE"
"1358"	"14"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"JANE"	"Ignore that, I'm still doing it, Ian's taking Lucy shopping as he promised."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"14"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"After the way she spoke to me? I don't think so."	"MALE"
"1358"	"14"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"JANE"	"Remind me - which one of you's the hormonal teenager? Only it's hard to tell sometimes."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"14"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"I made the offer, didn't I?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"14"	"CAFE INT DAY LIGHT"	"JANE"	"And it's not bonding if you then withdraw it. When did Peter ever get an A+?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"You can't chuck me out. Not for that."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"You said you were clean."	"FEMALE"

"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"Marijuana is a drug, Rainey - you lied to me."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"No, I didn't. I said I wasn't on smack or coke and I'm not."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"Well, let's hear it for the class B drug addict. Congratulations on your down grade."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"What did he say? The social worker? He said it didn't matter, didn't he?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"That as long as I didn't have it in the house, or smoke it near the children, it wasn't a problem and d'you know how I know that? Because I asked. When I took the test. Because I didn't want to be anything but a help to you. Tan, if I was a danger, a risk, I'd go. I promise. You wouldn't have to pack for me, I'd have left already."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"He also said I should consult my solicitor. Which means there is a risk."	"FEMALE"

"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"You think Max's lawyer isn't going to use this? Try and turn it into something more substantial?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"But if I'm clean. If I keep taking the tests -"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"They're so worried she'll slip, your honour, she has to be tested every week, that's how much faith her own sister has in her. I'm sorry, but I'm not taking any chance that jeopardizes me keeping my kids."	"FEMALE"

"1358"	"15"	"[NAME] & [NAME]'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"You said, you'd go! If there was a risk. You just promised. So, what was that? Just you lying to me again, yes?"	"FEMALE"

"1358"	"16"	"VIC DOWNSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"I still don't get why Honey changed her mind. It was a bit freaky really. She just came in, starting hugging me, saying she was going. She is safe, isn't she? You know, mentally."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"16"	"VIC DOWNSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yes, course she is, you're the one who's deluded - thinking I imagine you two in the shower, that sort of thing. That's what's mental. What?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"16"	"VIC DOWNSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"I've never said anything about a shower. Have you?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"16"	"VIC DOWNSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"RONNIE"	"Nope. I think that one's all you, Billy."	"FEMALE"

"1358"	"16"	"VIC DOWNSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"It's just some papers that need a witness signature. For Ben's trust fund. Ritchie's bringing them over this afternoon. You don't mind, do you?"	"MALE"

"1358"	"18"	"CAR LOT INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Yes, Jack picked a good ‚un with you, didn't he? Enjoy it, did you? Playing me for a mug?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"18"	"CAR LOT INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"That punter outside, he saw you come in. He's probably calling the police now."	"MALE"
"1358"	"18"	"CAR LOT INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"And telling them what? I ain't done nothing, Darren. Ain't going to either. Not yet."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"MAX"	"If you're waiting for Jack, he's seeing Ronnie Mitchell now, sorry. Still, I doubt he'd want my cast-offsanyway."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"Rainey's gone. I've told her to leave."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"MAX"	"That's a shame. I expect she'll be visiting, mind."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"No. No visits either. You'll have to find some other way to make me look like an unfit mother."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"MAX"	"‚S not much of a challenge."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"Abi'll be hurt the most. Lauren too, they really liked her. It's your children you're damaging. Again."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"MAX"	"They're why I'm doing this."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"Yes, you love that lie, don't you Max? ‚My kids mean more to me than anything' - except a quick romp with Stacey, of course."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"MAX"	"That's a different thing entirely."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"Why is it? You knew what you were risking. Your marriage. Your children's happiness, peace of mind - but you did it anyway."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"MAX"	"I made a mistake. I've said that."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"But you don't regret it. That's the thing. You don't regret Stacey. All you regret, Max, is getting found out."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"MAX"	"No."	"MALE"
"1358"	"20"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"TANYA"	"You did it, because you thought you'd get away with it. And deep down, you still do. You think one day I'll forgive you and then you can go back to playing the family man. Until the next girl comes along, of course. Which is why it won't happen. Not ever. Cos I'd hate to think how old that next girl would've been."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"There's a lot of other places we could've gone. You sure you want to get something here?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yes, why?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Well, it's a bit..."	"MALE"

"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Yes, they're exactly the words that spring to mind."	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Ignore him. He's about 150. He peaked on style with his haircut. Oh, I like this. That's great."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Is there a finished version? One with sleeves and proper neckline."	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Dad, shut up, will you?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"STACEY"	"Here. It goes with this skirt."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"You mean, napkin. Don't you sell any actual clothes?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"STACEY"	"Does he have to be here?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"If you want to get paid, yes he does."	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"We're meant to be bonding. You said I could choose an outfit."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"An appropriate outfit. Do you work in a lap dancing club?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"STACEY"	"How do you know what lap dancers wear?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"What? Do you mind? I'm talking with my daughter."	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yes, but how do you? Have you been to one?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"I said, choose something else."	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"No. I want to buy this."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Tough. There is no way I'm paying good money for that."	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Whoops. I suppose he'll have to now."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"STACEY"	"It's a designer label. ‚S forty five."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Pounds? Right, that is coming out of your pocket money."	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Fine."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"And you're grounded. There's no disco tonight. D'you hear me?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"21"	"BRIDGE STREET EXT DAY LIGHT"	"STACEY"	"Nothing like a bit of bonding, is there?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"But what's he doing still out? I thought he'd be arrested, that's what you said would happen."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"I know. Change of plan."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"What?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"You might have mentioned Phil had bribed you beforehand. 200 notes to keep quiet? That makes you an accomplice, you muppet. I give that tape to the police now you two'll be sharing a cell - is that how you want this to go? Well? Look, you wanted revenge for Kevin, right?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yes. And just that. Make Phil pay, I said."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"And that's exactly what he's going to do. He's going to pay by giving you the car lot. The freehold, it's yours. That's right. He'll sign it over to me first, then I'll give it to you when you're 18."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"If I get to 18. Which right now ain't looking very likely."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"Don't worry. He can't touch you."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"You think?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"Trust me."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yes, I've done that and look where it's got me. I've got psycho Phil Mitchell on the loose wondering which part of my body he's going to crush first."	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"Darren, listen -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"You promised me he'd go down, that he'd be arrested straight away, you said that, that I wouldn't be in danger, you said they might not even have to use the tape at all -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"23"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"Just get a grip, okay? Look at me. You're going to be fine. Phil won't hurt you. I guarantee it. Now sit down. And listen up, cos what you decide here Darren, is going to determine how the rest of your life goes."	"MALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yes, hold on, let me read it."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"No, I've done all that. I just need your signature. Get it back over to Ritchie. She's got to get it finalised before the weekend."	"MALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"I thought we'd done all the trust fund stuff - is this a new one?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"No, it's something to do with the new tax laws, bottom line, it's saving us money."	"MALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well, I'm all in favour of that. Where is it? Here?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Yes. And down here."	"MALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well, lift it up a bit, I've got to see what I'm doing."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"That's great, thanks."	"MALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Don't mention it. Got to protect our future, haven't we?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"24"	"VIC UPSTAIRS INT DAY LIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Absolutely."	"MALE"
"1358"	"25"	"R AND R INT DAY LIGHT"	"JACK"	"I chose you for a reason, Darren. You're ambitious, motivated and you've got a world of guts - not many people would've agreed to take Phil Mitchell on. But you need to prove to me you can live with the pressure of the choices you make. Do that, and you'll be owning a lot more than a crappy car lot in a few years time. See, what I'm offering you here, is an apprenticeship. If you can't handle it just say so now. I'll give you some money, you can head off, start again somewhere else. Or you can accept the risk, stay here, and learn how to really play the game. It's up to you. That or this. What are you going to do?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"William's asleep and Pat's reading Janet a story - it's so lovely seeing them together, she's really taken with Pat already."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"I told you, didn't I? I mean, I know you liked it at the Vic but this is better for us -"	"MALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yes, I should've listened to you earlier, Billy. I'm sorry."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"No, you had your reasons, good ones too but... Why did you change your mind?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Billy, you're so special. You have no idea what you do to people, have you? The effect that you have."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Eh?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"You've got to be very nice to Roxy from now on, d'you hear?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Yeah? Why's that then?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Well, let's just say I'm not the only girl who's heart you've stolen. If you hadn't chosen me Billy I'd be suffering just as much so don't you make things any worse for her, okay? I love you."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"ROXY"	"What are you looking at?"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"26"	"SQUARE EXT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"Nothing. ‚S okay, I get it now. Sorry. I should've realized."	"MALE"
"1358"	"27"	"BEALE'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"JANE"	"It's just a slight sprain, I took him to the doctors - there's nothing to worry about -"	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"27"	"BEALE'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"I can start training again on Monday."	"MALE"
"1358"	"27"	"BEALE'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Monday? That ruins my entire schedule."	"MALE"
"1358"	"27"	"BEALE'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"JANE"	"Yes, well the doctor had a few words to say about that as well. He advised that we consult someone qualified, get more expert advice."	"FEMALE"
"1358"	"27"	"BEALE'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"IAN"	"Recommend someone, did he? His mate I expect, probably gets a back hander for all referrals - see, those coaches, they do it for the money, but me, I'm doing this for Peter. Ain't that right, son? Sorry."	"MALE"
"1358"	"27"	"BEALE'S HOUSE INT DAY LIGHT"	"OTHER"	"No, he's really injured, he's not faking and I've been grounded so you'll have to go on your own."	"FEMALE"

"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"PHIL"	"So call the police."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"JACK"	"What are you having?"	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"PHIL"	"Now? Or eventually."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"JACK"	"See, that's sharp. I like that. We could really get on, you and me - if you just gave us a chance."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"PHIL"	"You're right. I didn't treat you with any respect. Now I know who I'm dealing with, I'll play things differently. Okay? Tape."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"JACK"	"That's the original - on the memory card. And that's the copy I made for the sound system this morning."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"PHIL"	"That better be the only copy. You come asking for something else, you know what you'll get."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"JACK"	"Like I said, this makes us even. All I want now, Phil, is your friendship. You need a favour from me, it's yours. Just ask. That's how this thing should work."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"PHIL"	"I'll bear that in mind."	"MALE"
"1358"	"29"	"R AND R INT NIGHT"	"JACK"	"No hard feelings then."	"MALE"

I remember, me and Grant, we'd be sitting there watching him, you know sparing with the other boxers. Quiet as mice we'd be. That's how we learnt.
